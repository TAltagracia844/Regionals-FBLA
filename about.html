    <article class="story">
        Halcyon Fashion grew from the passion that three people shared. Tiffany Altagracia, Cynthia Sepulveda, and Trent Peterson all living in the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona and attending the same school, found each other asking the very same question. How do we give the world cuter fashion, cleaner deserts, healthier animals, tighter communities - all while decreasing earth’s pollution? We spent months coming up with an effective idea that would solve all of these products. After many sleepless nights, cups of coffee, and stress filled days, we finally designed a solution that would change the way we saw our marine life. But what, and how?

<!-- Our Process -->
    <article class="process1">
      <h2 id="processTitle">Our Process</h2>
      Firstly, Halcyon Fashion sends a truck to San Diego, California, which is done so to pick up the trash that the boat send out twice weekly to do so has collected. After loading the truck with as much trash as it can fit, it drives back to our warehouse in Glendale, Arizona. Upon delivering the trash to our machines, our workers will see to it that each piece is thoroughly washed by our washers. Then, when the trash is safe to handle by humans, we sort the trash into different materials that can be made to use trendy clothes. After the materials are melted down or broken down into usable/manipulatable raw versions, we sew clothes that we have designed. As a customer places an order, we fill said order, and ship it within the day.
