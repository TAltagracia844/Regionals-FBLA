    <article class="story">
      Halcyon Fashion grew from the passion that three people shared. Tiffany Altagracia, Cynthia Sepulveda and Trent Peterson, all living in the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona and attending the same school, found
      each other asking the very same question. How do we give the world cuter fashion, cleaner deserts, healthier
      animals, tighter communities - all while decreasing earth’s pollution? We spent months coming up with an
      effective idea that would solve all of these products. After many sleepless nights, cups of coffee, and stress
      filled days, we finally designed a solution that would change the way we saw our desert life. But what, and how?

    <!-- Our Process -->
    <article class="process1">
      <h2 id="processTitle">Our Process</h2>
      Firstly, Halcyon Fashion sends a truck to our Valley <center></center>, which is done so to pick up the trash that the crew sends out twice a week. After loading the truck with as much trash as it can fit, it
      drives back to our warehouse in Glendale, Arizona. Upon delivering the trash to our machines, our workers will
      see to it that each piece is thoroughly washed by our washers. Then, when the trash is safe to handle by humans,
      we sort the trash into different materials that can be made to use trendy clothes. After the materials are melted
      down or broken down into usable/manipulatable raw versions, we sew clothes that we have designed. As a customer
      places an order, we fill said order, and ship it within the day.

            <p>Trent Peterson is a 16 year old mormon, lifeguard, nature lover, Eagle Scout camper. His love of the
              great outdoors is what got him looking into how to help nature by reusing trash to keep it out of
              landfills and the ocean. He hopes that one day nature can be trash free but at the moment he does his
              best to keep trash away from nature and if he can make other people happy by creating fashion then thats
              just a added bonus.</p>
